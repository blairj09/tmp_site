I first learned of [**#SoDS17**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoDS17&src=tyah) through [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme) and was further enlighted by [Data Science Renee's](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci) tweet

and accompanying [blog post](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2017/05/29/summer-of-data-science-2017/). As described, the basic premis is simple: set a goal to learn something new in the broad data science domain and make an effort to share the journey with others. As far as specific rules, Renee provides the following 3:

1. Pick a thing or a short list of things related to data science that you want to learn more about this summer.
2. Make a plan to learn it (like an online course, a practice project, etc.).
3. Share that plan on social media, then post updates as you make progress, with the hashtag #SoDS17.

The main idea of **#SoDS17** is simple and the rules are straightforward. In my opinion, that's what makes this idea so fantastic - it allows me to pick *a few* things I really want to focus on. Then I commit to accountability by sharing my goals publicly. This seems like a much better approach than my Trello board filled with an overwhelming number of loosely defined data science goals for myself. So, I'm going to give **#SoDS17** a shot.

## My goals
1. Establish an online voice
  - Create a blog on [rbind.io](https://support.rbind.io/about/) and *regularly update it* (regularly updating entails at least once a month)
  - Since this post is part of said blog, the first part of this goal has successfully been completed
2. Get better at the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/)
  - While this seems like a rather broad goal (and it kind of is) I've done my best to narrow it down to a few actionable and reportable items:
  - Read [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) and blog about what I've learned with each chapter
  - Watch related tidyverse sessions from [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)\
3. Build my own deep learning model in R using Keras
  - I've been intrigued by deep learning for a while now. Every time I hear [Ben Taylor](https://twitter.com/bentaylordata) speak it get's me all excited and motivated to learn all over again. However, my prior justification for not diving in has been "But... Python...". With the relase of [Keras for R](https://rstudio.github.io/keras/) I can no longer lean on that crutch so it's time to take the dive.
  - To help me wrap my head around the concepts and theory behind deep learning, I'm going to read the [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and blog about it
  - Once I feel ready to dive in, I'll create my own network (Using R + Keras) and publish a blog post about it
  


So, there they are - my 3 **#SoDS17** goals. Now that they've been released into the wild, it's time to be serious about them. Feel free to follow up on my progress through [twitter](https://twitter.com/Blair09M) or [here](https://batteriesnotincluded.rbind.io/) on my blog. I'm looking forward to what I can accomplish this summer and sharing the journey with any who are interested.
