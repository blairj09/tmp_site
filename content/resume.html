<div id="professional-profile" class="section level2">
<h2>Professional Profile</h2>
<p>I’m a data scientist because I believe the universe around us communicates with countless signals. Some we can reliably measure, others we are still unaware of. However, understanding how to effectively capture, process, interpret, and understand those signals is critical to our progress both individually and collectively. I believe that at its very core, the role of a data scientist is to <em>improve the human experience</em> by increasing our understanding of one another and the universe. Because of this perspective, I’m passionate about data and the development and efficient use of tools for interpreting and making use of that data.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>I’ve proven myself as both a capable writer and an enthusiastic and engaging speaker. I’m confident explaining complicated concepts in clear and concise terms and I’m as comfortable in front of the board as I am in front of my family. I’m always striving to improve my communication toolbox, from dynamic and intuitive visualizations to more engaging speaking practices.</p>

<div id="machine-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>I’m comfortable with a large variety of algorithms and frameworks and have repeatably demonstrated the ability to quickly learn new techniques and technologies. I’m at home with the complete machine learning pipeline, from conceptualizing the problem to preparing and cleaning the data to developing initial models to evaluating model performance to moving the final models into stable production.</p>
