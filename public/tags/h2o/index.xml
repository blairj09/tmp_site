      <description>I’ve seen a lot of buzz recently on Twitter revolving around the concept of AutoML. Essentaily, the automation of data preprocessing, model generation and, in same cases, feature engineering. I remember attending the H2O Open Tour last year and being totally riveted listening to Ray Peck outline the AutoML roadmap for h2o. This sounds like exciting, almost magical stuff with the ideal seemingly being as simple as providing the software with the data, pushing a button, enjoying a nice afternoon off, and seeing what model resulted the next morning.</description>
