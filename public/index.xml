      <description>Iâ€™ve noticed a lot of recent discussion around the latest version of dplyr and itâ€™s reliance on the tidyeval framework. In fact, twitter has been flooded with recent references to tidyeval.
Tis the season when many of us are coming to terms with #tidyeval and feel the need to tell you about it. It&#39;s like CrossFit for #rstats! ðŸ˜‰ https://t.co/CcmFteTc6l â€” Jenny Bryan (@JennyBryan) June 28, 2017   ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I broke R.</description>

      <description>Professional Profile Iâ€™m a data scientist because I believe the universe around us communicates with countless signals. Some we can reliably measure, others we are still unaware of. However, understanding how to effectively capture, process, interpret, and understand those signals is critical to our progress both individually and collectively. I believe that at its very core, the role of a data scientist is to improve the human experience by increasing our understanding of one another and the universe.</description>

      <description>I first learned of #SoDS17 through Mara Averick and was further enlighted by Data Science Renee&amp;rsquo;s tweet
Here&amp;#39;s how to participate in the Summer of Data Science #SoDS17:
&amp;mdash; Data Science Renee (@BecomingDataSci) May 29, 2017 
and accompanying blog post. As described, the basic premis is simple: set a goal to learn something new in the broad data science domain and make an effort to share the journey with others.</description>

      <description>Me I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist at Front Analytics and a graduate student at the University of the Pacific. I received my undergraduate degree in statistics from Brigham Young Unversity. I enjoy all things data, particularly all things data that live in the R universe.
I&amp;rsquo;m an avid sports fan and an unashamed bandwagon Warriors fan (although I feel some legitimate connection to the team now that I attend school in the Bay Area).</description>

      <title>h2o Auto ML</title>

      <description>Iâ€™ve seen a lot of buzz recently on Twitter revolving around the concept of AutoML. Essentaily, the automation of data preprocessing, model generation and, in same cases, feature engineering. I remember attending the H2O Open Tour last year and being totally riveted listening to Ray Peck outline the AutoML roadmap for h2o. This sounds like exciting, almost magical stuff with the ideal seemingly being as simple as providing the software with the data, pushing a button, enjoying a nice afternoon off, and seeing what model resulted the next morning.</description>
