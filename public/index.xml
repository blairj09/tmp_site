      <description>Professional Profile I’m a data scientist because I believe the universe around us communicates with countless signals. Some we can reliably measure, others we are still unaware of. However, understanding how to effectively capture, process, interpret, and understand those signals is critical to our progress both individually and collectively. I believe that at its very core, the role of a data scientist is to improve the human experience by increasing our understanding of one another and the universe.</description>

      <description>I first learned of #SoDS17 through Mara Averick and was further enlighted by Data Science Renee&amp;rsquo;s tweet
Here&amp;#39;s how to participate in the Summer of Data Science #SoDS17:
&amp;mdash; Data Science Renee (@BecomingDataSci) May 29, 2017 
and accompanying blog post. As described, the basic premis is simple: set a goal to learn something new in the broad data science domain and make an effort to share the journey with others.</description>

      <description>Me I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist at Front Analytics and a graduate student at the University of the Pacific. I received my undergraduate degree in statistics from Brigham Young Unversity. I enjoy all things data, particularly all things data that live in the R universe.
I&amp;rsquo;m an avid sports fan and an unashamed bandwagon Warriors fan (although I feel some legitimate connection to the team now that I attend school in the Bay Area).</description>
